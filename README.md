We will explore Feature attribution method which is local explanation technique that assign scores to feature based on certain criteria, such as local decision boundary. Feature score captures features contribution to the predicted value of an instance. We're not discussing the architectural model or prioritizing specific features. Instead, we're focusing on how the model arrives at particular decisions. This is crucial for understanding individual model predictions. It elucidates how each feature influences the prediction, whether it enhances or diminishes it
